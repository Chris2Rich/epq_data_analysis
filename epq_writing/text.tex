\section{Introduction}
The 21st century has seen significant economic growth as a result of high technology. This technological growth has undeniably permeated the majority of the human race however there is likely asymmetric economic growth as a result of capital market macro-structure, international and intranational capital flows, exposure to equity markets and other such factors, that can increase or decrease the economic benefits of increases in the capabilities of high technology.
There are many key components in a valid answer to this question, these being:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An accurate and representative definition for high technology as without this, the firms and agencies who develop such technologies will be excluded from any datasets or falsely included, distorting any financial analysis or trends in research and development spending.
    \item An understanding of the incentive structures of the aforementioned markets to understand who benefits from any change in equity price, debt, compensation, etc.
    \item Application of the statistical techniques that can be used to extract useful information from raw data for the purpose of rigorous evaluation of previous conclusions based on the assumptions made by any given paper.
\end{itemize}
In order to answer the question, a large number of primary sources will be used in order to find statistically significant trends and patterns such as financial statements,and employment and salary data as well as a large number of government policy reports, investment analysis reports and investor relations reports.
