What counts as benefit? Consider economic (obvious) as well as social (latent) effects.

Why can statistics correctly explain any effect if we can only model equity prices and therefore portfolio values as random walks? - https://web.stanford.edu/~rehall/Stochastic-JPE-Dec-1978.pdf

How to measure subtle effects? Gather data into a timeseries and then use a combination of tests for stationarity and 1st differences to find a potential cointegration vector or a failure to reject null hypothesis showing limited connection. This can allow for knock on effects to be evaluated and quantified. https://quantedx.com/understanding-cointegration-in-time-series-analysis-and-applications/
