# Question - To what extent does high technology in the second millennium cause asymmetric growth?

# Majority of data is USA oriented.

## Serious Questions:

What counts as a high tech corportation? Use combination of consensus as given by various technologically developed governments as well as disgression although this needs to be justified.

What counts as benefit? Consider economic (obvious) as well as social (latent) effects.

What counts as asymmetric growth? Consider how symmetry is measured and what it could mean - different across individuals / groups / input.

Why can statistics correctly explain any effect if we can only model equity prices and therefore portfolio values as random walks? - https://web.stanford.edu/~rehall/Stochastic-JPE-Dec-1978.pdf

How to measure subtle effects? Gather data into a timeseries and then use a combination of tests for stationarity and 1st differences to find a potential cointegration vector or a failure to reject null hypothesis showing limited connection. This can allow for knock on effects to be evaluated and quantified. https://quantedx.com/understanding-cointegration-in-time-series-analysis-and-applications/
